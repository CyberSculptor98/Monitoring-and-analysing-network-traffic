# Monitoring-and-analysing-network-traffic
This Python script opens a raw socket to capture all network traffic. It then analyses the Ethernet, IPv4 and TCP headers of the received packets and outputs the information. Please note that this script does not provide a graphical user interface like Wireshark, but outputs the information directly to the console.
